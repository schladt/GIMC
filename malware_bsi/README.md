# malware_bsi

This directory contains **malware behavioral subset implementations (BSI)**. These are small, sanitized programs derived from real-world malware that faithfully emulate a **single malicious behavior / TTP** while removing all unrelated or dangerous functionality. In this project, they act as **stand-ins for real malware samples** and serve as the **behavioral targets** we aim to replicate and study through the GIMC pipeline. 🧪

## Contents & Safety ⚠️

- All code represented here is **benign and sanitized**.  
  It is curated solely to demonstrate specific TTPs and replicate system behavior for **research purposes only**.
- Because some patterns may still trigger **EDR or GitHub security alerts**, all source code is stored as **password-protected ZIP archives**.
- The standard password for all archives is:

  `gimc` 🔐

## Developer Notes 💻

- When adding or updating BSI code:
  - Keep implementations **benign** and **scoped** to the intended behavior.
  - Commit **only encrypted ZIP files** — never commit decrypted source.
- The repository `.gitignore` excludes anything in `*/tmp/`.  
  Best practice is to use a `tmp/` directory as your **working area** for decrypted files and build artifacts, and never commit anything from there.
